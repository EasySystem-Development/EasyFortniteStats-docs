# FAQ

## General

### The bot doesn't respond, what can I do?

## Stats

###  **My account was not found. What can I do?**

 Normally all accounts should be found. First, check if you might have a typo in your name. Also, if you are an Xbox or PlayStation 4 player, you may need to upgrade your Fortnite account on [https://epicgames.com/](https://epicgames.com/) to a full EpicGames account.

###  My stats are wrong. How can this be?

The bot retrieves the stats directly from EpicGames, so they can't be wrong. There might be a typo in your EpicGames, PlayStation Network or Xbox Live account name or a wrong account got selected. Also, it isn't possible to compare the stats with other sources, because the bot displays them differently.

###  My stats are not up to date. What is the reason?

EpicGames don't update the stats immediately after each match. You have to wait a bit until they update. Sometimes it may takes up to multiple hours.

###  Why does it say "Playtime since Season 7"?

EpicGames introduced the feature to track playtime in Season 7. That's why it's only been tracked since Season 7 \(even though you played earlier\).
