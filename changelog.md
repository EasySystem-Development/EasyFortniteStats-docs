# Changelog

## V3.3.1 - 2022-05-17

This patch comes with mostly under the hood changes implementing recently released Discord features.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Discord extended the Slash Command enforcement until 09/01/2022. Our migration period has been extended until 08/01/2022. This date marks the end of the availability of text commands. (eg.`!fn shop`)
{% endhint %}

### Additions

* Implemented Discords new [Command Permissions System](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots) available under `Server Settings -> Integrations -> EasyFortniteStats`
  * `/setup`, `/settings`, `/data` commands are only available for members with Manage Server permissions

### Changes/Improvements

* The stats command's name option now provides a search functionality for Fortnite Player names.
  * This function supports searching for EpicGames, Xbox Live and Playstation Network playernames.
  * EpicGames player IDs are also supported
  * Alternatively, you can enter a name or ID without selecting an option.
* The `/radio` command can now be used without selecting a radio station in the command itself. Instead a dropdown selection is shown. This is especially useful when just resuming a radio session.
* The `/radio` menu always shows a dropdown for switching the radio station, instead going trough 2 steps.
* We fixed a performance lack which should result in better performance and should reduce "Interaction doesn't respond" error messages
* Improved stats image creation speed
* Most commands have been enabled in direct messages
* Selecting a player name and a Discord user at the same time in the `/stats` command now result in an error message for clarification.
* Improved a few messages to make things more clear

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue that caused an endless loading state when retrieving your stats or linking your account
* Premium enabled server wasn't able to use the `/data` server commands.
* Fixing issue problems when interaction with the radio menu while bot is disconnected&#x20;

## V3.3.0 - 2022-02-01

{% endhint %}

* Added a Context User Command which allows receiving the stats of a specific user. Just right-click a user in your server -> Click ''Apps" -> Select "User Stats"

  * This command is only available as a slash command
