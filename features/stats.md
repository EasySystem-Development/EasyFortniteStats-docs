You might want to select a custom background image for the stats image. Therefore you first need to upload an image with `/image upload`. If it falls below the maximum image size specified below, you can select it.&#x20;

* Image Format: `.png`, `.jpg` and `jpeg`
* Recommended Lifetime/Season Image Resolution: `1505 × 777`
* Recommended Competitive Image Resolution: `1505 × 624`
* Max. image size: `1MB`

You can also deselect the image from the dropdown menu, which will disable the custom background image.
