# Radio

The radio function allows you to listen to the radio stations from the game, which are usually only available when driving a car.

To start a radio session, simply join a voice channel where the bot also has access to. The `/radio` command makes the bot join and starts playback.

## ðŸ”¸Premium features

* **24/7 playback** - The player won't stop, if you leave the channel and also reconnect, after the bot restarts
* **Volume control** - By default volume is set to 50% to save bandwidth. You will be able to adjust it up to 200%.

## Permissions and DJ Role

By default, the currently active player is owned by the player who started it. Additionally all users with `Administrator` or `Manage Server` permission can also interact with the player. Furthermore a role named `Fortnite Radio` (name isn't case sensitive) is also able to control the player at any time.

{% hint style="info" %}
If only team members should be able to access the radio, for example, because it runs in 24/7 mode, all users should have their permissions removed for the /radio slash command.
