# Language

The bot offers various languages that can be useful when setting up the bot or can be set for communities whose members speak only one specific language. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
All translations except german are community-based and might not meet the default quality standards.
{% endhint %}

## Change the language

First, enter the following command to get into the settings menu:

```text
!fn settings
```

React with the language flag emoji. In case you change the language the first time, it should be the US flag ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸   
Now a further menu should appear including all available languages. React with the flag of the language of your choice.

{% hint style="success" %}
The language has now been successfully switched.
{% endhint %}
