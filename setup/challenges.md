## Setup Challenges updates

If you are using the bot for the first time or you have reset the settings, you have to set up the Challenges function for the first time.

First, enter the following command:

```
!fn challenges settings
```

Click the blue-button to set up Challenges updates. If you can't see this button, you have already set up Challenges. Then you can continue in the [modify Challenges settings section](challenges.md#modify-challenges-settings).

The bot asks for the channel where the Challenges should appear. You can either enter the channel **name**, channel **mention **#channel, or insert the channel **ID**. Please send a message just including this information.

#### Possible Errors

* **Channel not found** **•** The given Channel doesn't exist in your server.
* **Missing permissions** **• **The Bot missing permissions. The bot shows you which ones are missing. If you are inexperienced with Discord check out [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-How-do-I-set-up-Permissions-) to set up permissions.

Once it's done you now can decide whether you like to set up a role that should be mentioned once new Challenges appears.&#x20;

If you don't need this, you can skip this step, press the red X and finish up the Challenges setup.

If you like to continue setting up a Challenges mention role, you can continue by clicking the green checkmark.
