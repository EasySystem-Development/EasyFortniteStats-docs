## Setup Server Status updates

First, enter the following command:

```
/setup server-status
```

Click the blue button to set up Server Status updates. If you can't see this button, you have already set up Challenges. Then you can continue in the [modify Server Status settings section](status.md#modify-server-status-settings).
