## Setup Server Status updates

If you are using the bot for the first time or you have reset the settings, you have to set up the Server Status function for the first time.

First, enter the following command:

```
/setup server-status
```

Now you need to **select** at least one **channel** where the Server Status will be broadcast.&#x20;

### Set Channel

#### Possible Errors

* **Missing permissions** **â€¢** The Bot missing permissions. The bot shows you which ones are missing. If you are inexperienced with Discord check out [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-How-do-I-set-up-Permissions-) to set up permissions.
* **Too Many Webhooks** **â€¢** The selected channel got too many webhooks. You need to delete at least one in the channel settings.

Once you have selected a channel, the server status is set up. It should now appear in the selected channel.
