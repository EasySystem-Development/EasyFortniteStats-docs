# Server Status Setup

## Setup Server Status

### Set channel

First, enter the following command:

```text
!fn status setup
```

The bot first asks for the channel where the server status should appear. You can either enter the channel **name**, channel **mention** \#channel, or insert the channel **ID**. Please send a message just including this information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you decide for entering the channel's name, you need to check if the channel name is unique in your server.
{% endhint %}

#### Possible Errors

* **Channel not found** **â€¢** The given Channel doesn't exist in your server.
* **Missing permissions** **â€¢** The Bot missing permissions. The bot shows you which ones are missing. If you are inexperienced with Discord check out [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-How-do-I-set-up-Permissions-) to setup permissions.

## Modify Server Status Settings

First, enter the following command:

```text
!fn status settings
```

A reaction menu will pop up showing you all server status settings. Click the reaction of the setting you like to modify.
