## Setup Item Shop updates

First, enter the following command:

```
/setup shop
```

Click the blue button to set up Item Shop updates. If you can't see this button, you have already set up the Item Shop. Then you can continue in the [modify Item Shop settings section](shop.md#modify-item-shop-settings).
