As long you are not experienced with Discord's permissions system, keep all permissions selected.\
Click the **Authorize** button and complete the **Captcha**. You now should get redirected to [this page](https://docs.easyfnstats.com/invite).

## Invite troubleshooting

### &#x20;I can't find my server. What's the reason?

The main reason for your server not appearing in the drop-down menu is the use of the wrong account. Make sure you're logged into the right account which you can check on the top of the invite screen. You should see your profile picture and Discord tag. If it's the wrong account, press the **Not you?** button.

### Discord asks me to verify my e-mail address.

If you like to add a bot to a server you require an account with a verified e-mail. Head over to your user settings and verify your e-mail.
