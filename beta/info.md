# Beta Info

The Beta Program allows you to test new upcoming features.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The BETA bot is unstable and it is very likely that errors will occur
{% endhint %}

It's not recommended to use the Beta versions as your main bot due to the following disadvantages:

* Longer/More frequent downtimes
* Errors are likely to occur
* Shop, Challenges, and Server Status updates are delayed up to 30min
* Premium access will be delayed by up to 1h

If you don't mind the things mentioned above, you can invite the beta bot at the following link:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The beta bot's prefix is `b!fn` eg. `b!fn shop`
{% endhint %}
