# Beta Info

{% hint style="danger" %}
The Beta bot is unstable, and it's highly likely that you will encounter errors.
{% endhint %}

We do not recommend using the Beta version as your primary bot due to the following disadvantages:

* Longer and more frequent downtimes
* Increased likelihood of errors
* Delays of up to 30 minutes for Shop, News, and Server Status updates (except for Premium users)
* Premium access may be delayed by up to 1 hour

If you're okay with these potential issues, feel free to add the Beta bot.

#### What's New in the Beta Bot?

The latest features available for testing in the Beta bot can be found in the changelog. Look for latest updates if it contains the suffix **-BETA**. If not, the Beta bot will have the same features as the regular version.
